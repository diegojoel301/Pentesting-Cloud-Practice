<h1>Level 1: Hint 2</h1>

You now know that we have a bucket named `flaws.cloud` in `us-west-2`, so you can attempt to browse the bucket by using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">aws cli</a>  by running:

<pre>
aws s3 ls  s3://flaws.cloud/ --no-sign-request --region us-west-2
</pre>

If you happened to not know the region, there are only a dozen regions to try.  You could also use the GUI tool <a href="https://cyberduck.io/?l=en">cyberduck</a> to browse this bucket and it will figure out the region automatically.

<p>Finally, you can also just visit <a href="http://flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/">http://flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/</a> which lists the files due to the permissions issues on this bucket.
